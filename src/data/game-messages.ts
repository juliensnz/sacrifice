      'For ages Vikings raided and traded from their Northern European homelands across wide areas of Europe.',
      'This pagan people believed in numerous anthropomorphic Gods and Goddesses who express human emotions and in some cases are married and have children.  Among them, Odin, Frigg, Thor, Aegir, TÃ½r, Loki, Freyja, Heimdall and Balder are some of the most well-known.',
      'The Viking society was divided into the three socio-economic classes: Thralls, Karls and Jarls. Thralls were the lowest ranking class and were slaves. Karls were free peasants. They owned farms, land and cattle. The Jarls were the aristocracy of the Viking society. They were wealthy, owned large estates and care of administration, politics, hunting, sports, visited other Jarls or were abroad on expeditions. When a Jarl died and was buried, his household thralls were sometimes sacrificially killed and buried next to him.',

But it was a piece of cake with you. You're my pet now. You're, my puppet. And I have a last sacrifice to perform... The Gods will be proud of me! Ah ah ah!`,

Your father was too powerful and respected. But you... You wretch... You are nothing. Guards! Put him in jail! Exile is a way too soft punishment. He will be the next sacrificed! He will be my gift to Odin! Ah ah ah!`,

Decades of darkness are now behind us. The future is bright. You have opened our eyes and showed us the true light. Your are the worthy heir of your father. Long live the Jarl!`,

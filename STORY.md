## Intro

### Historical context

(ECRAN NOIR, LE CONTEXTE EST EXPLIQUE AVANT LE DEBUT, COMME DANS UN FILM)
(CHAQUE PARAGRAPHE DOIT S'AFFICHER EN FONDU)

For ages **Vikings** raided and traded from their Northern European homelands across wide areas of Europe. The Viking society was divided into the three socio-economic classes: **Thralls**, **Karls** and **Jarls**.

**Thralls** were the lowest ranking class and were slaves. **Karls** were free peasants. They owned farms, land and cattle and engaged in daily chores like plowing the fields, milking the cattle, building houses and wagons, but used thralls to make ends meet.

The **Jarls** were the aristocracy of the Viking society. They were wealthy and owned large estates with huge longhouses, horses and many thralls. They took care of administration, politics, hunting, sports, visited other **Jarls** or were abroad on expeditions. When a **Jarl** died and was buried, his household **Thralls** were sometimes sacrificially killed and buried next to him.

### Story

(CHAQUE PARAGRAPHE DOIT S'AFFICHER EN FONDU, APRES CHAQUE SON DE SACRIFICE. RYTHME LENT ET OPPRESSANT)
(UTILISATION DE L'IMAGE DE VILLAGE DE NAO, SANS FORNIR)

Your father, the Jarl of the village, passed away last week. Every inhabitant saw him as the feared and respected leader he was. He lead the people to glory, opulence and wealth thanks to his sense of military strategy.

As all its predecessors, and with the help of his shaman's advises, he perpetuated the ancestral tradition aimed to please the Gods. Each new moon comes with a ritual. Each new moon comes with a price. Each new moon comes with a choice. Each new moon comes with a sacrificed...

Beware the Gods... Or they could punish you. (SIGNE RELIGIEUX)

Keep the trust of your people... Or they will exile you. (SIGNE TRUST)

Now you are the new Jarl of...

Fórnir

## Anonymous letter

My dear Jarl,

The shaman is malicious and cruel. He is not looking for the forgiveness of the Gods, but rather to increase his own power. Please, don't trust his advises blindly, this could lead to your end, and to the despair of your people.

– An anonymous inhabitant that wants the well-being of his fellow citizen.

## Game over

### All villagers sacrificed

Ah ah ah! You really listened to me and sacrificed all of your people? You fool. It has always been so difficult to convince your father. But it was a piece of cake with you. You're my pet now. You're, my puppet. And I have a last sacrifice to perform... The Gods will be proud of me! Ah ah ah!

– The shaman

### No more trust

Ah ah ah! My people don't trust you anymore. They started a rebellion and elected me as their new Jarl. I finally obtain what I always wanted. Your father was too powerful and respected. But you... You wretch... You are nothing. Guards! Put him in jail! Exile is a way too soft punishment. He will be the next sacrificed! He will be my gift to Odin! Ah ah ah!

– The shaman

### No more faith

My Jarl, on behalf of the whole village, thank you. Our people is free. Free from this malicious shaman. Free from this horrible ritual. Free from those useless beliefs. Decades of darkness are now behind us. The future is bright. You have opened our eyes and showed us the true light. Your are the worthy heir of your father. Long live the Jarl!

– A villager

## Intro

### Historical context

(ECRAN NOIR, LE CONTEXTE EST EXPLIQUE AVANT LE DEBUT, COMME DANS UN FILM)
(CHAQUE PARAGRAPHE DOIT S'AFFICHER EN FONDU)

For ages **Vikings** raided and traded from their Northern European homelands across wide areas of Europe. The Viking society was divided into the three socio-economic classes: **Thralls**, **Karls** and **Jarls**.

**Thralls** were the lowest ranking class and were slaves. **Karls** were free peasants. They owned farms, land and cattle and engaged in daily chores like plowing the fields, milking the cattle, building houses and wagons, but used thralls to make ends meet.

The **Jarls** were the aristocracy of the Viking society. They were wealthy and owned large estates with huge longhouses, horses and many thralls. The thralls did most of the daily chores, while the **Jarls** did administration, politics, hunting, sports, visited other **Jarls** or were abroad on expeditions. When a **Jarl** died and was buried, his household **Thralls** were sometimes sacrificially killed and buried next to him, as many excavations have revealed.

### Story

(CHAQUE PARAGRAPHE DOIT S'AFFICHER EN FONDU, APRES CHAQUE SON DE SACRIFICE. RYTHME LENT ET OPPRESSANT)
(UTILISATION DE L'IMAGE DE VILLAGE DE NAO, SANS FORNIR)

Your father, the Jarl of the village, passed away last week. Every inhabitant saw him as the feared and respected leader he was. He lead the people to glory, opulence and wealth thanks to his sense of military strategy.

As all its predecessors, with the help of his shaman's advises, he perpetuated the ancestral tradition aimed to please the Gods. Each new moon comes with a ritual. Each new moon comes with a price. Each new moon comes with a choice. Each new moon comes with a sacrificed.

Beware the Gods... Or they could punish you. (SIGNE RELIGIEUX)

Keep the trust of your people... Or they will exile you. (SIGNE TRUST)

Now you are the new Jarl of...
